<p>Costco is quietly slashing prices. This feels wrong.

    I go to costco every week. it’s probably the only thing i do consistently. i’ve been doing it for years, i know how the prices move. lately? everything’s discounted. i’m not talking promo tags or little manufacturer markdowns — i mean whole shelves of items dropped 20-40%. across categories. not seasonal either.
    
    this isn’t normal. prices are supposed to be going up with tariffs, inflation, shipping costs, whatever. instead they’re dumping inventory. aggressively. either demand is collapsing or something upstream is forcing their hand.
    
    it just doesn’t make sense. it feels off. maybe i’m overreacting, but i’ve never seen price drops like this since i started going. if this is what it looks like at costco — the most stable, boring, buy-in-bulk fortress of consumerism — then i don’t really want to know what’s coming next.
    
    maybe it’s nothing. but probably not.</p>
